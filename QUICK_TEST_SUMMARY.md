## 📊 Understanding the Scoring

**Weighted Algorithm:**

- **70% weight**: Skills matching
- **30% weight**: Years of experience

**Skills Matching:**

- Exact match: "Java" = "Java" ✅
- Case-insensitive: "JavaScript" = "javascript" ✅
- Abbreviations: "JS" = "JavaScript" ✅
- Fuzzy: "React.js" = "React" ✅

**Experience Matching:**

- Calculates years from work history date ranges
- Compares against job requirements
- Scores higher if experience matches or exceeds requirement

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Load multiple formats** - Try PDF and DOCX resumes if you have them
2. **Custom job descriptions** - Write your own to test flexibility
3. **Database persistence** - Close and reopen app, candidates should remain
4. **Skill variations** - Test synonyms like "K8s" vs "Kubernetes"
5. **Experience requirements** - Adjust years in job description to see score changes
