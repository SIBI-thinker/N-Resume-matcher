### Alternative Run Methods

**Using Java directly:**

```bash
mvn package
java --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar target/resume-parser-job-matcher-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

**From IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse):**

- Open project
- Navigate to `MainApp.java`
- Right-click â†’ Run

## Basic Usage Flow

1. **Load Resumes**

   - Include section with "Required Skills:" and list skills
   - Optionally include "Experience: X years"

3. **Match Candidates**

   - Click "Match Candidates" button
   - View results sorted by match score
   - Top match is highlighted in success message

4. **Review Results**
   - Check matched skills vs missing skills
   - Use candidate contact info (email/phone) for outreach
   - Export or save results as needed

## Sample Job Description Format

```

```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Clean and build
mvn clean install

# Run application
mvn javafx:run

# Package as JAR
mvn package

# Clean build artifacts
mvn clean

# Skip tests during build
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Resume Format

- Use clear section headers (SKILLS, EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE)
- List skills with commas or bullets
- Include contact information at the top

### Job Descriptions

- Database file is `database.db` in project root

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

**Problem**: Application won't start

```bash
# Solution: Clean rebuild
mvn clean install
mvn javafx:run
```

**Problem**: NLP models not found

```bash
# Solution: Check models directory
ls -la src/main/resources/models/
# Should see: en-token.bin, en-ner-person.bin
```

**Problem**: JavaFX error

```bash
# Solution: Verify Java version
java -version
# Should be Java 11 or higher
```

**Problem**: No candidates showing

```bash
# Solution: Check database
# Delete database.db and restart application
rm database.db
mvn javafx:run
```
